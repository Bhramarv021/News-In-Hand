# News-In-Hand
This is a NEWS FEED APP which gives a user regularly-updated news from the Internet.
To achieve this, I use the Guardian API. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.

### What I learnt!
This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:

- Connecting to an API
- Parsing the JSON response
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Updating information regularly
- Using an AsyncTask
- Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
- Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
